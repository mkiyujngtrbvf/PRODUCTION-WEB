                    When I was a kid, I had a strong passion for drawing and sketching.
                    Later on, that passion for art slowly started to fade.
                    After I learned some basic mobile editing techniques, I gradually got interested in editing.
                    For a while, I used to do edits just for myself.
                    Then I thought why not get into programming?
                    So I started learning front-end development.
                    After discovering some UK rap artists and being influenced by a few of my friends,
                    I slowly felt drawn toward becoming a music producer.
                    Now Iâ€™m actively working on it, doing everything independently.
